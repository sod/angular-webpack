This directory contains the files from the package @angular-devkit/build-angular@13.1.2, directory `node_modules/@angular-devkit/build-angular/src/babel`.

Installing build-angular increases our node_modules from 600MB to 1400MB. But we just need those 6 javascript files.

Maybe in the future, angular may release this seperately (just like @ngtools/webpack), see https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/22401
